# process
try to follow the mock up of my work page 
i have no idea how to do like icon and review icon
i fail to make the right responsive size of all the image
the work page is the only page not similar to the mock up
use the basic contact form somehow not exactly same as mock up
# deal with some problem
firstly build with bootstrap
but i can not find a proper way to edit css(may because i use imported online bootstrap css)
delete all the code and restart
set all the break point
